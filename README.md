Snake Game with Pygame
This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python's Pygame library. The game includes background music and a custom background image to enhance the visual and auditory experience.

Features
Classic Snake Gameplay: Control the snake using the arrow keys to collect food and grow.
Background Music: Looping background music during the gameplay.
Custom Background Image: A background image enhances the game's aesthetics.
Score Tracking: Tracks the player's current score and high score during the session.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the game:

Python 3.x: Install the latest version of Python.
Pygame: Install the Pygame library using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Files
snake.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the game logic and implementation.
Music File: The background music file should be placed in a music folder.
Background Image: The custom background image should be placed in an images folder.
How to Run
Prepare Assets:

Place your background music file in the music folder. The default music file is expected to be back.mp3.
Place your background image in the images folder. The default image file is expected to be snake.png.
Run the Game: Open the Jupyter notebook (snake.ipynb) in your environment and execute all the cells to start the game.

Game Controls:

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
Collect the food to grow the snake and increase your score.
Customization
Changing Background Music: Replace the back.mp3 file in the music folder with your own .mp3 file.
Changing Background Image: Replace the snake.png file in the images folder with your own image file.
Game Logic
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or with itself.
Scores are updated in real-time, and the high score is tracked within the session.
Future Enhancements
Add multiple levels or difficulty settings.
Introduce obstacles for more challenging gameplay.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy customization of game settings.
